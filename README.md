# assignment3
task1
Function factorial(n):
Starts with result = 1.
Loops from 1 to the number you gave (n).
Multiplies result with each number in that range.
For example, if n = 5:
→ 1 × 2 × 3 × 4 × 5 = 120
input() asks the user to type a number 
print() shows the final answer.


task2
import math: This brings in Python’s built-in math library so we can use functions like sqrt(), log(), and sin().
input(): Takes a number from the user. We use float() to allow decimal input.
Math functions used:
math.sqrt(num) → Gives square root.
math.log(num) → Calculates natural log (base e).
math.sin(num) → Gives sine of the number (in radians).
print()
